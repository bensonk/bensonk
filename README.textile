This app is designed to act as a personal home on the web.  My motivation in
creating it is primarily to make it easy to update from my phone on the road as
I continue on a long bike trip.  Since I'll be looking for work as we finish
the trip, I'm hoping to make it easy to see what I'm about and why I might be
an interesting job candidate.
